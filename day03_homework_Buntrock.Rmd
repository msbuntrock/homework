1. Identify a numeric column in your data. Find the 95th %ile value of that column.

```{r}
library(carData)
data(Vocab)
Vocab.score <- Vocab$vocabulary
quantile(Vocab.score, seq(0,1, .05))
         

```

2. Subset your data to be only include values greater than that extreme 95th %ile

```{r}
vocab.score.high.percent <- subset(Vocab, Vocab$vocabulary > 10 )
```

3. Now find the lowest 5th %ile, and subset to the data that includes both the lower extremes and upper extremes

```{r}

quantile(Vocab.score, seq(0,1, .05))
vocab.score.high.n.low <- subset(Vocab, Vocab$vocabulary > 10 & Vocab$vocabulary <2 )
```
